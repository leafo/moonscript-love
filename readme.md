# This Project Is Dead!

This is a dead project. It's an old version of
[MoonScript](http://moonscript.org) and an old version of
[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

I recommend installing MoonScript locally, and compiling your `moon` files to
`lua` files before testing your game. You can also distribute the compiled lua
code.

If you want to have MoonScript be compiled on the user's computer (eg. you want
to eval MoonScript code during runtime), you can package the MoonScript module
with your game and just `require "moonscript"` in `config.lua`.

## Why

I originally created this project because there weren't Windows binaries of
MoonScript. Now that MoonScript is really easy to install on Windows there is
no point for this. (Even though it would be pretty cool if MoonScript came with
all distributions of LÖVE.)
